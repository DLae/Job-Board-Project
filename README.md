# Job-Board-Project
This repo contains everything that I managed to complete during my time with the DWP as work experience.

During my work experience I spent 9 weeks with the Digital team at DWP, I was apart of a very welcoming team in which I was able to develop my coding knowledge in java/javascript using React JS and Node.
The main part of my work experience was a meaningful project in which I was given the task of creating a digital version of a Job Board that could potentially see its way into production in the future.
This is all of the code that has been used to create the Job Board and make it look like what it did when we went to trial it in a job centre.
